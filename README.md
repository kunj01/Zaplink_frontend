# Zaplink — Secure QR Code & File Sharing Platform

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This frontend requires a **backend server** running to work properly. See [BACKEND_SETUP.md](BACKEND_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

## 🎯 About This Project

Zaplink is an open-source platform that lets you transform any file, link, or text into a **secure, shareable QR code** — instantly. Whether it's a PDF report, a video, an image, or a URL, Zaplink wraps it in a unique short link and QR code that you can share anywhere.

Every "Zap" (your uploaded content) can be locked with a **password** and configured to **self-destruct** after a set number of views or a time limit — making it ideal for sensitive, time-critical content sharing.

Zaplink also lets you **customize your QR code** with frames, logos, and styles before downloading or sharing it. It's built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, and is maintained by **GDG CHARUSAT** as part of their open-source learning initiative.

## ✨ Features

- 📁 **Multi-format Support** — Upload PDFs, images, videos, audio, documents, presentations, ZIP archives, URLs, and plain text
- 🔐 **Password Protection** — Lock any Zap with a password so only authorized people can access it
- 💣 **Self-Destruct** — Set a view-count limit or an expiry time after which the link stops working automatically
- 🎨 **QR Code Customization** — Choose from frame styles (rounded, circle, shadow, gradient, border) and embed your own logo
- ⚡ **Instant QR Generation** — Get a QR code and short link in seconds, no registration required
- 🌗 **Dark/Light Mode** — Full theme toggle support for a comfortable experience
- 📱 **Fully Responsive** — Works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop

## 🚀 Quick Start for Contributors

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm
- Git
- **Backend Server** (REQUIRED - must be running before testing uploads)

### Installation & Setup

#### Step 1: Clone & Install Frontend
```bash
# Fork and clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Zaplink_frontend.git
cd Zaplink_frontend

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/gdg-charusat/Zaplink_frontend.git

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

#### Step 2: Get the Backend Running (CRITICAL!)

The frontend **REQUIRES** a backend server running on `http://localhost:5000` for uploads to work.

##### Option A: Backend in Sibling Directory (Recommended)
```bash
# In a NEW terminal, from parent directory
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/gdg-charusat/Zaplink_backend.git
cd Zaplink_backend

# Install and start backend
npm install
npm start
```

✅ Backend should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`

##### Option B: Backend on Different Port
Create `.env` file in frontend directory:
```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Replace `3000` with your actual backend port, then start frontend.

##### Option C: Using Docker
```bash
cd ../Zaplink_backend
docker build -t zaplink-backend .
docker run -p 5000:5000 zaplink-backend
```

#### Step 3: Start Development Frontend

In the `Zaplink_frontend` directory (in a NEW terminal):
```bash
npm run dev
```

✅ Frontend will open at `http://localhost:5173`

### ✓ Verify Setup is Correct

Open browser DevTools (F12) and check the console:

**✅ Success - You should see:**
```
ℹ Development Mode: Using Vite proxy for /api routes
📍 Proxy target: http://localhost:5000 (default)
```

**❌ Error - If you see:**
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)
AggregateError [ECONNREFUSED]
```

**This means:** Backend is NOT running! Follow Step 2 again.

### 🛠 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Upload returns 404** | Backend not running. Start it: `cd ../Zaplink_backend && npm start` |
| **ECONNREFUSED error** | Backend not running on port 5000. Check `npm start` output in backend terminal |
| **Backend on different port** | Create `.env`: `VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:YOUR_PORT` |
| **"Cannot find module" errors** | Run `npm install` in both frontend AND backend |
| **Port 5000 already in use** | Either kill that process or use a different port with `.env` config |

### 📝 Common Development Flow

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd ../Zaplink_backend
npm start
# Should show: Server running on http://localhost:5000

# Terminal 2: Frontend  
cd ../Zaplink_frontend
npm run dev
# Should show: Local: http://localhost:5173
```

### 🔄 After Changes

- **Frontend changes**: Automatically reload in browser
- **Backend changes**: Restart the backend server (Ctrl+C, then `npm start`)
